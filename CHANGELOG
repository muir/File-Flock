SunOS systems seem to fail with EWOULDBLOCK on locked files.

+ 1999/06/21

It appears that on some systems (HP-UX) a blocking call to flock()
can fail with EACCES instead of EAGAIN.

+ 1999/06/15

Perl changes.  File::Flock must change to keep up.  A call to
lock() had to be changed to &lock().  Why?

More fixes for Solaris.  

Modified the unlock() function so that it can be called as a reference.

+ 1998/11/30

Fixed the object-style interface.  

Attempt to fix a double-unlock bug that makes the Linux port unhappy

+ 1998/11/26	

Chaged O_RDONLY to O_RDWR for all file opens because Solaris won't let
you get an exclusive lock on a read-only file.  Crazy!  Change suggested
by Lupe Christoph <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de>.  Thanks!

Rewrote the handling of the removal of files created just so that
they could be locked.  Also tried to make sure that now file descriptors
could get leaked.
