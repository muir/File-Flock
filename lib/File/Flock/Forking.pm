=head1 NAME

 File::Flock::Forking - adjust File::Flock to handle fork()

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Flock::Forking;
 use File::Flock;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The purpose of File::Flock::Forking is to change the implementation
of L<File::Flock> to handle locking on systems that do not hold
locks across calls to fork().

If you are using L<File::Flock> or any module that uses L<File::Flock>
then and your program uses fork(), then you should import
File::Flock::Forking before you import L<File::Flock> or any module that
uses L<File::Flock>.

On most operating systems, File::Flock::Forking does nothing.  On
Solaris, it changes the behavior of L<File::Flock> to be implemented
by L<File::Flock::Subprocess>.

You can also force it to use L<FIle::Flock::Subprocess> by with

	$ENV{FLOCK_FORKING_USE} = 'subprocess'

Or force it to use L<File::Flock> with

	$ENV{FLOCK_FORKING_USE} = 'flock'
